### Arrays
What You’ll Learn in This Hour:

* What we mean by the array data type
* How to declare and populate arrays
* How to manage array contents

Sometimes it makes sense to store multiple variable values under a single
variable name. JavaScript has the array data type to help you do this.

In this hour you’ll see how JavaScript arrays are created and how the data
stored in these arrays can be manipulated in code.

Exercise
Review the array and string methods that share a method name. Familiarize
yourself with how the syntax and operation changes depending on whether these
methods are applied to a string or an array.
